        content: "<p>After four weeks of NGS Season 20 Division A, Gen.M Esports has found its stride. Following a rocky opening week, the team has stacked three straight victories, capped off by their first domination win (2–0) this week against Let’s Spam Dehaka.</p><p>The turnaround began in Week 2, where Gen.M Esports secured a 2–1 victory over The Librarians, and continued in Week 3 with another tight 2–1 win against Braincellmates. But in Week 4, Gen.M Esports finally delivered the decisive performance, sweeping Let’s Spam Dehaka without dropping a map.</p><p>In the post-match interview, team captain infafox reflected on the team’s growing momentum:</p><ul><p>“Yeah, I think we got a lot more doms in us at this point. We’re approaching matches with a more level-headed mindset, not just ‘we should win,’ but ‘okay, let's win.’ That authority is starting to show in our play.”</p></ul><p>He didn’t shy away from voicing frustration about the season-opening loss to The Part Timers (a team featuring former Gen.M Esports player Cauthon):</p><ul><p>“Love Cauthon and all, but damn, that sucked. We should not have lost that. Nothing personal, just the frustration. Then after a couple of 2–1 wins it was like, ‘man, we can do so much better, this is annoying.’ So this week felt right — like, finally, this is how we’re supposed to play.”</p></ul><p>Gen.M Esports’s next test comes in Week 5, with a high-stakes matchup against Salt Team Six on Wednesday, September 10 at 9:30 PM ET. Adding intrigue to the showdown, Salt Team Six features GreekFire, a former Gen.M Esports player who competed with the squad in recent seasons</p>",
